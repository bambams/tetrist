Tetrist is a work-in-progress falling block game clone similar in nature
to a certain classic game from the 80s. There are plans to add some kind
of spin to the gameplay to make it unique, but to start development is
focused on getting basic gameplay working (an MVP you might say).

At the time of writing the program only has limited functionality. It
spawns blocks, which fall until they collide and spawn a new piece. The
player can move left, right, or accelerate their descent, but cannot yet
rotate pieces. Filled lines are also not yet cleared. When collision
occurs at the top of the game board game-over is declared, and a timer is
presented counting down to a new game starting.

= TODO =

The basic missing functionality is:

- Player being able to rotate the blocks.
  - Collision detection working with rotated blocks (either we can store
    the various possible rotated collision maps, or figure out how to do
    the calculations on a rotated map)..
- Clearing filled lines.
- Counting the player's score.
- Storing a scoreboard.

Extended functionality:

- Basic sound effects.
- Prettier graphics.
- Pixel-based graphics and logic (as opposed to tile-based).
- "Flare" (unique ideas to set it apart from other games/clones).

= INSTALL =

== Dependencies ==

To build the program you will need Allegro 5 installed. See liballeg.org
(official site) or allegro.cc (community forum) for details.

== Makefile (Unix-like) ==

You will need make (development is using GNU make, but in theory it
doesn't matter). While the program should compile and run on Windows, the
makefile is probably Unix-like specific and depending on various Unix
utilities.

$ make

The makefile supports various targets for convenience, such as `rebuild',
'run', and 'rerun'. To run the game you can either invoke an appropriate
Makefile target to run it from within make, or just execute the game
directly.

$ make run
$ # OR
$ ./game

== Compiling (Alternative) ==

If the Makefile doesn't work on your platform you can always just compile
all the *.c files manually. Then just execute the resulting program.
